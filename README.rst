bootstrap-virtualenv
====================

This is just a simple Bash script that creates and populates a new virtualenv
for a Python project.  If the ``virtualenv`` program is not available in the
$PATH, this script downloads it from upstream and runs it locally to create the
virtualenv for the project.
